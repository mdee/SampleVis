SampleVis is an interactive multi-form display of the top 20 artists in music, completed as a project for CS 838 @ UW Madison (~3 weeks dev time).
The purpose of the project was to gain familiarity with the D3 javascript library and demonstrate some of the knowledge gained about visualizations in the course thus far.

Data was graciously supplied by WhoSampled.com, and is in the file whosampled_top20_sampled_artists.csv

There are two main sections of code, the java code and the markup / clientside code.  

The java code is located under the java/ folder and includes all of the code used to read in the supplied CSV, put it into a SQLite database (data.db), query the database for information, wrap it into a manageable state for D3, and write the data out to JSON.

The clientside code contains the meat of the application, which is all of the javascript used to generate the interface and interactions.

Thanks for looking!
